# pawbuddy

Pawbuddy is a remake of my laboratory activity from my Web Systems and Technologies course during the third term of my second year in BS Computer Science program.

The project was originally done with C# and ASP.NET .NET Framework as it was the required programming language and framework for said course. CSS is also used for styling the website. 

As someone who was unfamiliar with the capabilities of CSS at the time, I find the UI of the website very poor-looking to my standards, as the color palette lack contrast and the layouts are not cohesive and responsive. Which is understandable at the time since the main focus is to build a fully functional website that has form validations.

This improved remake is done with HTML5, SaSS/SCSS, and JavaScript. I also used GSAP for the animations in the landing page.
